//! This file defines the `StatCategory` enum, which represents different categories of stats in the game.
//!
//! It was introduced because the increase to some stats may result in an increase to other stats.
//! For example, increasing acuity also increases intelligence if the character is a caster with intelligence as a primary stat.
